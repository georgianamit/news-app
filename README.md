## News App made in ReactJS

In this project, I have used the `newsapi.org`<br/>
So, in order to run this project you have to have the apiKey offered by them and its free for development.



### How to run this app

* create a file `.env` in root folder and include this<br/>
  `REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY="<YOUR APIKEY>"
   REACT_APP_API_ROOT="http://newsapi.org/v2"`
* Then run `npm ci`
* and then to run the app use `npm run start` command.

## Enjoy!
